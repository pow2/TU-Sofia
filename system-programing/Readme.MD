A simple program for searching a word in multiple files using posix threads for searching in all files simultaneously.
Works for both Windows and Linux OS.
As for the presentation - well it is kind of bad, but this was pretty much my first time using .ass for something interesting and I wasn't familiar with the tags and all macros, but no less it is quite amazing that you can make presentation entirely from subtitles. The actual fun part starts at 0:04:02.13 - 0:04:20.00
